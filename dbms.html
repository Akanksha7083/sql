<b><h2>What is a Database?</h2></b>
<p>As the name suggests, a database is a place where all the data gets stored in a structured format. It helps the users 
    to easily access, manage and update the required information. So, in layman terms you can understand, a database as a 
     big container wherein all the information about a website, or an application is stored in a structured format. You can get
      a better understanding with the SQL Certification Course.

 

    For example, a company can have various details of employees, such as name, empID, email, blood group, salary, and so on.
     All these details can be stored in a database with the name “Employee” in a structured format such as tables, hierarchy, etc.
    
    In any organization, be it a startup or a hyper-growth company, many databases can be present, but it is very important
     to manage those databases in a proper manner. So, next in this article let us understand how to manage these databases.</p>

     <b><h2>What is DBMS?</h2></b>
     <p>DBMS or Database Management System is a software application used to access, create, and manage databases. With the help
         of DBMS, you can easily create, retrieve and update data in databases. A DBMS consists of a group of commands to 
         manipulate the database and acts as an interface between the end-users and the database. Refer below.</p><br><br>

         Database Management Systems allows users to do the following:<br><br>

1.Define Data :Allows the users to create, modify and delete the definitions which define the organization of the database.<br>
2.Update Data : Provides access to the users to insert, modify and delete data from the database.<br>
3.Retrieve Data :Allows the users to retrieve data from the database based on the requirement.<br>
4.Administration of users : Registers the users and monitors their action, enforces data security, maintains data integrity, monitors performance and deals with concurrency control.<br><br>
 

<b><h2>Database Languages in DBMS</h2></b>
<p>A DBMS has appropriate languages and interfaces to express database queries and updates.<br>
    Database languages can be used to read, store and update the data in the database.</p><br><br>

    <b><h2>Types of Database Languages</h2></b><br><br>
    <b><h2>1. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h2></b><br><br>
    <p>1.DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is used to define database structure or pattern.<br>
       2. It is used to create schema, tables, indexes, constraints, etc. in the database.<br>
       3. Using the DDL statements, you can create the skeleton of the database.<br>
        4.Data definition language is used to store the information of metadata like the number of tables and schemas, their names, indexes, columns in each table, constraints, etc.<br><br>
        <b>Here are some tasks that come under DDL:</b><br>
        
        1.Create: It is used to create objects in the database.<br>
        2.Alter: It is used to alter the structure of the database.<br>
        3.Drop: It is used to delete objects from the database.<br>
        4.Truncate: It is used to remove all records from a table.<br>
        5.Rename: It is used to rename an object.<br>
</p>
    <b><h2>2. Data Manipulation Language (DML) </h2></b>
    <p>DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is used for accessing and manipulating data in a database. It handles user requests.<br>

<b>Here are some tasks that come under DML:</b></p><br>
1.Select: It is used to retrieve data from a database.<br>
2.Insert: It is used to insert data into a table.<br>
3.Update: It is used to update existing data within a table.<br>
4.Delete: It is used to delete all records from a table.<br>
<b><h2>3. Data Control Language (DCL)</h2></b>
<p>3.DCL stands for Data Control Language. It is used to retrieve the stored or saved data.
    The DCL execution is transactional. It also has rollback parameters.<br><br>
    
    <b>Here are some tasks that come under DCL:</p><br></b>
    
    1.Grant: It is used to give user access privileges to a database.<br>
    2.Revoke: It is used to take back permissions from the user.<br>
   </p>

    <b><h2>4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)</h2></b>
    <p>tCL is used to run the changes made by the DML statement. TCL can be grouped into a logical transaction.<br>

        <b>Here are some tasks that come under TCL:</b><br>
        
        1.Commit: It is used to save the transaction on the database.<br>
        2.Rollback: It is used to restore the database to original since the last Commit.<br></p>
